# Incremental Relational Generator (IRG)

## Pre-requisites

1. `Python>=3.10`.
2. Dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Important Notes

The project is now in commercial usage, so the full executable code is not disclosed. This repository aims to provide
the code skeleton and reproduces the main logic for IRG. It is still executable, but some functions are filled with 
placeholders that do not do the same thing as what is described in the paper, and some core parameters are not exposed.

All core methods and functions in the codebase have docstrings describing what they do. Methods that are filled by 
placeholders are annotated with `@placeholder`. 

For a runnable (though perhaps buggy) earlier version of IRG, one can switch to `archive` branch to have a look at an 
older version of code.
